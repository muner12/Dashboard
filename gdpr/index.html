<h2>Processing of personal data</h2>

<h3>Data controller</h3>

<p>The Swedish Natural History Museum is data controller for processing of personal data.
</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>The Department of Botany at the Swedish Natural History Museum cares for, preserves and enriches scientifically and culturally important collections of plants, for the benefit of researchers and the general public. The purpose is to promote knowledge dissemination and research in systematics and biodiversity. In order for the objects to have a scientific value, the location, the date of collection and the name of the collector must be indicated on the label attached to the object, according to an international standard. The collection information is recorded in a collection database and presented through the Herbarium Catalogue (herbarium.nrm.se), which is available to the public as well as to the scientific community worldwide.
</p>
<p>The Department of Botany collects, records, stores and presents personal data in the database

We also process personal data to fulfill our obligations as a government authority on the preservation of official documents and the agency's archives.
</p>

<p>We process your name, geographical location and collection date linked to the object in question. By submitting an item to the museum, you consent to the preservation and incorporation of this information related to the submitted specimen into the museum's collection database of plant objects, and that the information is made public.
</p>
<h3>Legal grounds for processing of personal data</h3>
<p>The collection of information, including personal data, is part of the Swedish Natural History Museum's work to carry out our duties of promoting interest of, and knowledge and research on, the structure and development of the universe, the earth and life, biodiversity, human biology as well as the environment and landscape. This, in accordance with the government ordinance (2007: 1176), with instructions for the Swedish Natural History Museum.
</p>
<p>
The Swedish Natural History Museum should especially work to
</p>

In addition, the Swedish Natural History Museum processes personal data in order to fulfill the requirements for proper handling of the authority's official documents. The processing of personal data required by the Public Access to information and Secrecy and Archives Act, and which is compatible with the General Data Protection Regulation, is considered necessary for reasons of important public interest.
